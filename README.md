# modmath
-----
A Go API to solve Modular Arithmetic Problems. [GoDoc]

The package is go-gettable, although it is recommended to use [vgo].

```
vgo get -u github.com/deanveloper/modmath/v1

or

vgo get -u github.com/deanveloper/modmath/v1/bigmod
```

If you do not use [vgo], you may use `go get` instead of `vgo get` and everything will still work properly.
